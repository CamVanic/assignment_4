            <h1>Magic the Gathering Commander: The People's Game</h1>
            <h3>The story of how a group of players ganged up on their friend because Mana Drain</h3>

            <p>Within the realm of magic *cough: the gathering*, there are many battlefields.  Sit by the fire, children, so that you might hearken to a tail of passion, pride, and inevitable downfall.
               There are many arenas of battle in this world.  Perhaps a young mage would test his cunning in the realm of limited, fighting not with his own weapons, but instead adapting to those laid before them.
               Or mayhaps your prefence is Standard, where mages hone their arcane skills and innovative theories.  No?  Not particular to the sideshows and child-like wonder of lesser formats?  Then perhaps you would
               test your metal in the Modern and Legacy arenas, where only the most seasoned mages meet.  There is no room for showboating or pinache here.  These mages come for one thing: to test themselves against the
               best.

            <p>Our story, however, takes place in a different stadium, a more humble scene capable of both the brewing innovation of Standard and the fuckery of Modern.  This arena is known as Commander (or EDH if you're a hipster)
                Commander is a special place, where one can throw down the gauntlet against not just one, but as many other mages as their awkward social interactions will allow.  On this fateful battlefield, where kings are made and heroes
                prove themselves, four armies descended.  From the north, the ragged goblins.  From the south, the beastmaster and his army of hulking monstrocities.  To the east, the illusionist, and his terrifying powers of...milling.  
                And, to the north, some guy who spent way too much on his "spells" and dropped like 8 mana rocks down by turn 1 and then a Tamiyo.

            <p>It took little time for the winds of battle to shift.  The goblins and beasts, more instinctively attuned to nature, could smell doom on the air.  The mind-mage kept his distance, knowing just how powerful some guy who has no appreciation
                for the casual nature of commanded could be, how dangerous an adversary who did not possess the shame required to leave Mana Drain out of his commander deck...I mean list of spells.  Goblins multiplied like bunnies, hopping onto the backs of raging
                Baloths and tunneling Hydras.  The Great Hunter, Garruk, summoned his beasts and roared fearsomely to the skies.  Yet even the power of two grand armies could not suppress the slowly ticking deathclock of Tamiyo, the Moon Sage.  She had
                built her loyalty and readied her most deadly spell which would allow her to cast a plethora of spells without using her own magical energy.  As she cast her spell, the sky turned dark, the goblins and beasts paused, for they did not know what awaited them.
                As a bright light shined from the heavens, engulfing the moon mage, the mind mage reached out his hand and yelled a single incantation: <strong><em>"Disallow!"</em></strong>.

            <p>A hush fell over the battlefield.  The bright light fizzled, and with it Tamiyo disappeared.  The overbearing mage stared at his mana rocks and empty hand.  He stared at the charging hordes of goblins and beasts, behind them a mind mage's eyes glowing.  He mustered
                up a heartfelt "Guh?" as his world of overpriced spells fell down around him.  He did his best to hold off the hordes, but with each spell, he could feel the mind-mage's influence.  He felt the spells leaving his memory, and his thoughts slowly turning into a foggy
                haze.  Desperately, he tried to turn the hordes against the mind-mage, fearing he might lose himself in the blue magic.  But it was too late, and he watched helplessly as the hordes washed over him in an overwhelming stampede combined with cleansing flame.
            </p>
            <p>With the threat of some guy who can't commit to a theme for his deck gone, the hordes turned upon one another.  Goblins fell under beastly foot, and the mind-mage races to transmute the beastmaster into a vegetable before the beasts could overwhelm him.  In the end,
                that dude with overpowered cards, I mean spells, was right.  The mind-mage pulled out his victory, but not without cost.  The beasts had weakened him to a point where he could no longer stand.  Among the trials of war, it seemed as though there were no true victors.
                Or perhaps, as the dust settled, all of their names would be remembered throughout history.  Except that guy's...because no one likes people who play $80 spells.  What are we?  <strong>Kings?!</strong>

                As the mages regained their senses, they recounted the glory of the battle.  To the wire it went, a single Mind Grind for exactly enough for win was a narrow victory.  The Mind-Mage commended the Beastmaster on a good battle.  As they recounted, <strong>that guy sat in silence.  Beneath the fevered brow
                stewed a rage.  His eyes shifted to the rogues, the betrayers who had targeted him for his power, and then:</strong>
